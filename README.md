 OLD_RM_STYLE
Make a RM2K(3)-like game with RMVXAce!

- Can use "Graphics/System/Font.png" and "Graphics/System/Font_color.png" to write awesome OldSchool texts
- Can make the window box opaque (like RM2K) and/or stop the cursor blinking
- Can display the choice list inside the dialogue like RM2K(3)
- Can set shortcuts F4: toggle fullscreen, F5: toggle AWESOME TINY WINDOW MODE
- Can pixelate the screen display (for the care of the detail)
- Can set the resolution to 640*480 (okay, it's just one line BUT YES IT CAN)
- Can use RM2K(3) graphics directly (set all RESSOURCES_FEATURES to "true")
- Can deactivate the dash (shift)

This script is compatible with RME (RMEx) and Fullscreen++ (Zeus81)

In short ... configure it!
